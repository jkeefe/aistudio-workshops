    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to make a model that will work for our specific, unique problem: detecting whether helicopter flight maps show a copter was \"circling\" or \"not circling.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer learning with a pre-trained model\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve this problem would be to teach, or _train_ a _model_ – really a complex mathematical formula – to match images to labels. For good results, we'd need to use millions of images. It's doable ... but there's another option.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a _pre-trained model_ – one already trained by some other, kind people, who built it using millions of images and then shared it on the internet for others to use. We'll use the \"smarts\" of that model, which has learned to detect patterns in images generally, to solve our particular problem. We do that by _additionally_ training the original model on our own data set – the helicopter flight maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ResNet\n",
    "\n",
    "[ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) is a pre-trained model that was trained on the images and labels of 14 million pictures in a database called [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/about-overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a _neural network_ that has \"learned\" how to \"look\" at those images and make a guess of what the image contains from a list of 1,000 possible labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we want just two labels: \"circling\" and \"not circling\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So we strip off the last calculations of the ResNet model ... the part that guesses between 1,000 possibilites ... and train it with our images to guess just two possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### fast.ai\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fast.ai](https://fast.ai) is the software we'll use to take the complex mathematical formula described by the ResNet model, do transfer-learning on the original model with our custom maps, and apply the final model to new images. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to train a model to recognize helicopter flight maps as either \"circling\" or \"not circling\" using a relatively small number of training images (just shy of 300 total).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll start with a moodel pre-trained on 14 million image.\n",
    "- Next we'll use \"transfer learning\" with fast.ai to further train that model with our helicopter maps"
