There are [lots of options](https://course.fast.ai/index.html). I like to use use [the Amazon EC2 setup](https://course.fast.ai/start_aws.html), which is probably the most complicated. In most of these cases, you'll just clone [the workshop repository](https://github.com/Quartz/aistudio-workshops) and get the notebook running.\n",
